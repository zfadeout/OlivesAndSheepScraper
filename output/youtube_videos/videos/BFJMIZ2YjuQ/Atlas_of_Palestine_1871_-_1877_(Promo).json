    "description": "We are pleased to announce the publication of this Atlas, after several years of research. The Atlas shows Arab Palestine before the Zionist colonization of Palestine. It has 13,000 names of towns, villages and places. There was not one Zionist colony. The Atlas is based on the British Survey (SWP) organized by Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF), after having been checked for accuracy of maps and name correction. The Atlas of Palestine 1871 - 1877 is available through our distributors around the world. You can order your copy now by contacting your nearest distributor.",

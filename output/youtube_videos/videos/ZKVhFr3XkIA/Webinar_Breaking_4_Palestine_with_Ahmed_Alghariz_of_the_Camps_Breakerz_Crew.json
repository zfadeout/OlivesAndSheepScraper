    "description": "On Sunday, August 24th of 2025 we joined with trauma pedagogy and dance therapist Ahmed Alghariz of the Camps Breakerz Crew to discuss the way they use breakdancing as a form of somatic release to help children restore their sense of belonging and wellbeing in the face of ongoing siege, massacre, and forced displacement in the Gaza Strip. The Camps Breakerz Crew was founded in the Gaza Strip in 2004 by brothers Moh Ghraiz and Ahmed Alghariz, who formed the community dance team to represent the Palestinian people and draw attention to their struggle. CB Crew shares the unique beauty of breakdancing, hip hop, and art with the people Gaza through teaching and performances. They established the first dance school in Nuseirat Refugee Camp in 2012 providing children with professional instruction in dance, graffiti, and music. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can contribute to the Green Olive Collective at this link to sustain our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://giftjustice.com",

    "description": "On Sunday, January 12th we joined with Green Olive Senior Partner Mohammed Barakat to discuss the role of trade unions in the history of Palestinian popular struggle. The Palestinian trade union movement has always played a central role in the Palestinian struggle for political sovereignty.Trade unions were instrumental in mobilizing general strikes during the First Intifada, shaping Palestinian party politics into the present, and mobilizing workers to fight for dignity despite the conditions of occupation. Mohammed Barakat organized hotel and hospitality workers during the First Intifada as a member of the executive board of the Hotels and Restaurant Workers Trade Union and the executive committee of the Progressive Workers Union. He spoke with us from experience about the development of Palestinian labor politics the larger context of Palestinian organized labor into the present. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can become a member of the Green Olive Collective at the following link to sustain our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

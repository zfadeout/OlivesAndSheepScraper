    "description": "In November, Israeli authorities demolished the entire Bedouin village of Umm Al-Hiran to make way for a new Orthodox Jewish settlement named Dror—meaning “freedom” in Hebrew. This came despite the community’s years-long efforts to negotiate with the government to remain on their land and live side by side with the new Jewish residents. Their pleas were ignored. They were treated with contempt throughout. Now, reports have surfaced that subsidized plots in Dror were awarded to settlers—including the son of far-right minister Bezalel Smotrich—exposing the corruption and racism at the heart of this project. The state not only broke its promises to Umm Al-Hiran’s residents but continues to systematically dispossess its own citizens for political and ideological gain. Where is our Jewish morality? We cannot go on like this. 📍 In the video: Rahat council member and deputy mayor Dr. Mazen Abu Siam, Farhan Abu Riash from the Hura local council, MK Naama Lazimi, and Avi Dabush, director of Rabbis for Human Rights.

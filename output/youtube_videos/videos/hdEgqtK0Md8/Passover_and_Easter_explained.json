    "description": "This online session will explore the similarities and differences between Passover and Easter. This April, Eliyahu and Malkon – respective hosts of our 'Meet the Orthodox Jews' and 'Christians of the Holy Land' online sessions – are joining forces. They’ll explain the meaning and origins of Passover and Easter and tell you about what the holidays mean to them and the Israeli and Palestinian communities they’re part of. Both men are committed peace builders and religious experts, and you’ll have the chance to ask them plenty of questions in this informal session.",

    "description": "www.zochrot.org / zochrot ____________________________________ We proceeded north on HaPalmach St. and turned right on HaCharuv St. After about 100m we arrived at a public park (to the right). This park was built over ruins of old village buildings, including an ancient mosque and the village public courtyard called al-Manzul. This was where the villagers were grouped by the occupying Israeli military in 1948, pushed on buses and expelled to the Jenin area.",

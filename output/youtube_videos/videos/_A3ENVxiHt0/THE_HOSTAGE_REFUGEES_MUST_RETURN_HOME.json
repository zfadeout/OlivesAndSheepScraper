    "description": "THE HOSTAGE REFUGEES MUST RETURN HOME. Here is how? This live documented illustration shows the longest and largest hostages in the world, not yet freed. Today 2.3 million Palestinians are crammed in 1% of Palestine, subject to single, double and triple Genocide in 2023, 2024, still in 2025. They are held hostages for 28,000 days, and counting, after being expelled by Israeli massacres in 1948 from their homes in 247 cities and villages in southern Palestine. They are not allowed to return home since. Instead, Israel continues to annihilate them. Their Right of Return Home is guaranteed by every article in international law.",

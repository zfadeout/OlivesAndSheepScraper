    "description": "The latest in our series of partnerships with like-minded civil society actors was with the Israeli NGO Zochrot (\"Remembering' in Hebrew). They have been working since 2002 to promote acknowledgement and accountability for the ongoing injustices of the Nakba, the Palestinian catastrophe of 1948. Umar Al-Ghubari discusses Zochrot’s work and introduces what the Nakba is. Green Olive's Yahav Zohar then takes us for a virtual tour of some of the depopulated Palestinian villages along route 1 to the west of Jerusalem. Finally we discuss the Palestinian refugees' Right of Return and explore Zochrot’s work to understand the practical and social changes needed to make this a realistic possibility.",

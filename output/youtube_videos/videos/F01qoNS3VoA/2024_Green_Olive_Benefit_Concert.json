    "description": "Contributions can be made at https://greenolivetours.com/contribut... - This extraordinary hour of music and solidarity features world class musicians calling for an immediate ceasefire to the ongoing killings in Gaza and the dispossession of two million people. In addition to fundraising, his event promotes empathy for the bereaved families and families of Hostages and prisoners, solidarity across borders, and a lasting peace. We hope it will serve as an expression of hope in this difficult time. The funds raised will assist Green Olive to develop more solidarity visits to Palestinian villages in the West Bank, assist human rights defenders, and further develop our network of over 500 members in 25 countries around the world. The organisation assists members with advocacy activities and solidarity relationships with besieged communities. Your contributions will also benefit HRDF: Human Rights defenders Fund and PCRF: Palestine Children's Relief Fund.

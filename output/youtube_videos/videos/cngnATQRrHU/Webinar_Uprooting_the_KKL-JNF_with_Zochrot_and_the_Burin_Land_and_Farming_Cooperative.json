    "description": "The Jewish National Fund is best known around the world for its forestation, tree planting, and environmental conservation efforts. This ethical image stands in contrast to the central role it plays in the expropriation of Palestinian lands. As the JNF continues to plant conifer forests on Palestinian land in the Galilee, Naqab, and West Bank, many thousands of Palestinian olive trees are at the same time being burned in arson attacks by settlers with soldiers standing by or accompanying the attackers. In the village of Burin alone, located between Huwara and Nablus in the northern West Bank, more than 2000 olive trees were burned in 2024. We partnered with the Burin Land and Farming Cooperative in an initiative to counter the JNF by planting Palestinian olive trees instead of JNF forests. We spoke with Ghassan Najjar of the Burin Land and Farming Cooperative and Umar al-Ghubari of Zochrot to learn more about the central role of the JNF in the continued dispossession of Palestinians and the ways we can act in direct solidarity with Palestinian farmers in the Nablus District and Jordan Valley. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can become a member of the Green Olive Collective at the following link to sustain our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

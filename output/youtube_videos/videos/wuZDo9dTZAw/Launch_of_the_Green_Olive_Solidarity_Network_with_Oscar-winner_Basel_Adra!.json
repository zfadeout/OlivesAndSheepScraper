    "description": "On Sunday, June 2nd of 2024 we joined with Oscar-winner Basel Adra, Gamar Hureini, and Emily Glick to launch the Green Olive Solidarity Network and speak about the urgent imperative of advocacy, mutual aid, and solidarity with communities living under military rule. In this time of ongoing anguish it is often difficult to know what we can do to express our solidarity and tangibly support Palestinians facing displacement, mass eviction, and unprecedented state violence. That is why we launched a new advocacy and mutual aid network that will allow people around the world to maintain direct and sustained relationships with Palestinians living under military rule and tangibly support on the ground activism in the occupied West Bank. Basel Adra is a Palestinian lawyer, journalist, filmmaker, and activist from A-Tuwani in Masafer Yatta. He is the director of No Other Land, a documentary that depicts the struggle of his community against mass eviction and received the Best Documentary and Audience Choice awards at the Berlinale Film Festival. Gamar Hureini is a member of Youth of Sumud and the Mothers of Sumud project in A-Tuwani in the South Hebron Hills, a women lead project which resists land in Area C of the occupied West Bank. She is a powerful advocate on behalf of her community and against military and settler violence in Masafer Yatta. Emily Glick is a solidarity activist who has worked for many years in support of Palestinian-lead civil resistance efforts in the South Hebron Hills through her work with the Storytelling Project, All That's Left: Anti-Occupation Collective, Center For Jewish Nonviolence, and Activestills. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can become a member of the Green Olive Collective at the following link to sustain our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

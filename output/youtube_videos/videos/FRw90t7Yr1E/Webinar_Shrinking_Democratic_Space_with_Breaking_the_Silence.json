    "description": "In January of 2023 the Green Olive Collective joined with Becca Strober of Breaking the Silence for a webinar reckoning with the aftermath of the Israeli elections and the stark impact of the new government on democratic discourse and human rights. With an ultranationalist coalition in power and Itamar Ben Gvir as National Minister of Security, we came together as a community invested in a vibrant culture of democracy and political expression to take stock of the political moment in light of the broader trajectory of occupation.",

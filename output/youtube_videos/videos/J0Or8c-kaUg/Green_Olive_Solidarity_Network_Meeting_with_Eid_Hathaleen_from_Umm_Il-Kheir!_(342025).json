    "description": "On Thursday, April 3rd of 2025 we joined for our monthly solidarity network meeting with Eid Suleiman from Umm Il-Kheir in Masafer Yatta. He is a longstanding community activist and has documented home demolitions, settler attacks, and human rights violations in Masafer Yatta for many years as part of broader efforts to counter settler violence, land expropriation, and forced transfer. Eid is also an internationally recognized artist who since the age of 12, has been building miniature-sized jeeps, bulldozers, and helicopters from plastic, iron, and other remains from home demolitions in Area C. Through his art he renders artifacts of oppression back into a constructive form that can be appreciated. Over the past months the residents of Umm Il-Kheir have faced relentless military violence, mass demolitions, settler attacks, and the repeated destruction of their water infrastructure, representing a dramatic and deliberate escalation of violence against the community. We were honored to join with Eid to hear about recent events and about the steadfastness of the community in the face of occupation.",

    "description": "On Thursday, May 2nd of 2024 the Green Olive Collective joined with Noam Perry of the American Friends Service Committee to learn about the role of the Unites States in arming the military campaign in the Gaza Strip in the half year prior, about the specific weaponry supplied, and about the historic relationship between the two military powers. We discussed how the military industry and arms trade function, and how we can hold corporations and governments accountable as we mark over half a year of devastation in the Gaza Strip. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can become a member of the Green Olive Collective at the following link to sustain our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

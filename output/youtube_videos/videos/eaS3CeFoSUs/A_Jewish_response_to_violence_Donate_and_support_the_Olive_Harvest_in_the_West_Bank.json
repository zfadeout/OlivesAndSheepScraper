    "description": "As Jewish extremism and messianic fervour resurface, we have a twofold mission. We work in the fields, supporting Palestinian farmers with their harvest, and we embody a different, morally conscious Judaism that values human rights and life above all else. Your support, no matter the amount, empowers us to make a meaningful difference. Every donation allows us to acquire essential equipment, expand transportation, and bolster our teams for a month of harvesting. Join us in shaping a better future. Donate now at: https://causematch.com/rhr_23 and be the force for change. To volunteer for our impactful harvest days, sign up at https://forms.gle/RHqKEVK5mukcriB36 Your hands and hearts can make a difference.",

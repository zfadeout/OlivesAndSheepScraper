    "description": "This tour was conducted as part of our efforts to expose the Palestinian destroyed villages erased on JNF sites and as part of the #ExposeJNF campaign which aims to highlight JNF's \"120yrs of dispossession and displacement\" of Palestinian land and People. The ruins and lands of hundreds of Palestinian villages communities are hidden in the JNF's forests and parks around the country. These sites do not mention the names of the destroyed villages or the Palestinian history of these places. In doing so, they are taking an active part in the erasure and denial of the Palestinian existence that began with the Nakba in 1948, and serve as a tool for shaping a false consciousness of the public. The signs on these sites do not mention the names of the destroyed villages or the Palestinian history of the place. In this video we visit the village of Dayr Aban, one of the several villages located and hidden in JNF's \"USA independence Park\".",

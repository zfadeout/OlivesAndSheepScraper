    "description": "#ReturnVision Sing for millions of Palestinians who DARE TO IMAGINE their return. As the #Eurovision19 coincides with the 71st anniversary of the Palestinian Nakba, and will be held on the land of the destroyed Palestinian village of Sheikh Muannas , ZOCHROT invites the artists around the world to sing for return. Vis-a-vis the ongoing erasure of Palestinian history, we choose to remember and offer a vision of a better future, a vision of return. Join us in our campaign of cultural resistance: send us your song, poem or music video clip to share your vision for return to: media@zochrot.org All submissions received before May 14, 2019 - the start of #Eurovision19 - will be highlighted as part of our Sing for Return campaign on social media and our web. Help us spread the word - tweet @Zochrot using the hashtag #ReturnVision",

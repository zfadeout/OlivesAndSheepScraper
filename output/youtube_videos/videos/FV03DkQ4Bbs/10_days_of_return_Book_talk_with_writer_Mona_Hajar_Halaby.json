    "description": "Return to Jerusalem: Book talk with Palestinian-American writer Mona Halaby Description A talk with acclaimed educator and writer Mona Hajjar Halaby about her book “In my mother’s footsteps: a Palestinian refugee returns home”. Halaby’s mother, Zakia, was born in Jerusalem and like hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, was forced to leave in 1948 because of the Israeli occupation. In the book, Mona writes about her return to Jerusalem to retrace her mother’s memories in a militarized and occupied city. Mona will be talking about her memoir with Mahmoud Muna, “The bookseller of Jerusalem”, a cultural activist born and raised in Jerusalem who manages the educational bookshop at the American Colony, one of the city’s most treasured cultural institutes. The talk is part of Zochrot’s “Ten Days of Return” series - events and activities to highlight Palestinian right to return and Israeli responsiblity between May 5th, Israeli “Independance” day And May 15th, Nakba Day.

    "description": "On Sunday, February 23rd of 2025 we joined for a screening of \"Burin Under Fire,\" a short film documenting the recent olive harvest and the popular struggle of the community in the face of military rule. This short film was made by the Burin Land and Farming Cooperative, a Palestinian agricultural collective and grassroots workers cooperative, to document the rootedness, steadfastness, and resilience of Palestinian farmers. The collective is committed to developing agroecology as a means of actualizing food sovereignty, environmental justice, and mutual aid in the face of both Israeli military occupation and the privatization of communal resources. We joined after the film to speak with Ghassan Najjar about new developments and projects they are advancing in Burin and with other communities in the Nablus District. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can become a member of the Green Olive Collective at the following link to sustain our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

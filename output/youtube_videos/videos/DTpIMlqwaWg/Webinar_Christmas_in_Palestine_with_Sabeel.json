Although the video is free to watch, please contribute towards our costs at https://greenolivetours.com/contribut... • 10% is donated to the Palestine Children's Relief Fund (PCRF). Sabeel,the Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center in Jerusalem, draws on Christian narratives and teachings as a source of resilience in the face of violent military occupation, and develops a Christian spiritual practice that centers the sanctity of the most marginalized.",

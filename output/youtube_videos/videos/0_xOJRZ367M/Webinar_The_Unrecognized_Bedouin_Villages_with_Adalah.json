    "description": "On Sunday, January 14th of 2024 the Green Olive Collective discussed the ongoing crisis in the Bedouin villages of the Negev with Marwan Abu Frieh of Adalah, a leading human rights organization and legal center promoting and defending the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel through strategic litigation and public advocacy. Marwan is the Naqab Office Coordinator of Adalah. He helped us understand the impact of events since October 7th on Bedouin citizens of Israel, who were among those taken hostage in Gaza, and on the villages enduring months of rocket fire. The events had worsened the already dire conditions in employment, infrastructure, and healthcare in these communities, all against a backdrop of historical discrimination and inequality. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can become a member of the Green Olive Collective at the following link to sustain our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

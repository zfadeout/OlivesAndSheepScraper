    "description": "“In times of war we all feel helpless. Perhaps through music we can spread some hope in our humanity.” – Wisam Gibran https://greenolivetours.com/concert-r... This event is free and open to the public. Sunday, March 3rd: 8PM Jerusalem • 7PM Berlin • 6PM London • 1PM NYC Join us for an extraordinary hour of music and solidarity featuring world class musicians calling for an immediate ceasefire, a return of the hostages, and a democratic future beyond occupation in Palestine/Israel. All proceeds will go to sustain solidarity work in 2024 and advance tangible initiatives in defense of human rights in the West Bank, where communities struggle every day to defend their rights in the face of attempted land expropriation, settler attacks, and military rule. The concert will feature a diverse cohort of musicians representing a variety of nationalities and genres including jazz, harp, folk, and rock from Israel/Palestine, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. We are excited to join with them and with all of you for what promises a special event promoting empathy, solidarity across borders, and a lasting peace. We hope it will serve as an expression of hope in this difficult time. https://greenolivetours.com/concert-r... This event is free and open to the public.

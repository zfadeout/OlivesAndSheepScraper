    "description": "We joined together on Sunday, October 29th of 2023 for Solidarity Speaks, the third session of our emergency webinar series highlighting Palestinian and Israeli voices of solidarity calling for an immediate ceasefire and an end to collective punishment in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The occupation regime does all it can to segregate Palestinians and Israelis. We were honored to join with three longstanding Israeli activists who have worked to build solidarity across checkpoints, border walls, and closed military zones for many years. They each shed light on the current moment and discussed the urgent need to build empathy and common cause against the limits of the dominant discourse set by Biden and Netanyahu. Noam Shuster-Eliassi is a comedian, creator, and unique cultural voice who uses humour to satirize and lampoon systems of racial inequality. She has gained global recognition for her uncompromising commitment to justice and her ability to challenge dominant narratives with hilarity and biting wit. Her comedy show Coexistence My A** is a groundbreaking work commenting on the absurdities of identity and power in Israel, Palestine, and the Middle East. Sahar Vardi is a prolific activist who began her solidarity work as a member of Anarchists Against The Wall supporting the popular struggle of Palestinians in Area C against land expropriation. Since then she is known for her participation in weekly demonstrations in Sheikh Jarrah and a variety of organizations including the Refuser Solidarity Network, Free Jerusalem, American Friends Service Committee, and others challenging unbridled militarism in Israeli society. Yossef Mekyton is an animal liberation, environmental, queer, and decolonial activist. During the Great March of Return in 2018 he helped organize Israeli solidarity demonstrations across the fence from the Gazan returnees. He is working with Zochrot to promote Israeli accountability for the Nakba of 1948 and a future beyond partitions. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can become a member at the following link to sustain the Green Olive Collective and our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

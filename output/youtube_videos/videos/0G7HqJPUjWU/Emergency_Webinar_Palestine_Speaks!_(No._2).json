    "description": "We joined together on Sunday, October 22nd for the second webinar of Palestine Speaks, an emergency webinar series giving people around the world a forum to hear directly from Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank about the ways their communities were impacted by events following October 7th and about the escalating violence they were experiencing. The occupation regime does all it can to fracture Palestinian society and isolate them from each other and the world. We came together to hear Palestinians speak in their own words, express our solidarity, and demand an immediate ceasefire and an end to collective punishment in Gaza and the West Bank. The featured speakers were: 🍉 Mustafa Sheta: General Director of the Jenin Freedom Theater, a lauded institution that offers drama and performance art education in the heart of the Jenin Refugee Camp. 🍉 Sameeha Hureini: Founder of the Mothers of Sumud project in Tuwani in the South Hebron Hills, a women lead project which resists settler expropriation of land in Area C. 🍉 Mohammed Barakat: Green Olive Senior Partner and first generation refugee whose family was expelled from their home outside Jerusalem in 1948. He worked in Palestinian labor unions, hospitality, and tourism for many decades. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can become a member at the following link to sustain the Green Olive Collective and our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

    "description": "On Wednesday, October 18th of 2023 we joined together for the first webinar of Palestine Speaks, an emergency webinar series giving people around the world a forum to hear directly from Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank about the ways their communities were impacted by recent events and about the escalating violence they experienced. The occupation regime does all it can to fracture Palestinian society and isolate them from each other and the world. We came together to hear Palestinians speak in their own words, express our solidarity, and demand an immediate ceasefire and an end to collective punishment in Gaza and the West Bank. We were joined by Khalil Abu Yahia in the Gaza Strip, Mustafa Alarag from Aida Refugee Camp, and Awdah Hathaleen from Umm Il-Kheir. Each shed light on the current moment and its implications for the future. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can become a member at the following link to sustain the Green Olive Collective and our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

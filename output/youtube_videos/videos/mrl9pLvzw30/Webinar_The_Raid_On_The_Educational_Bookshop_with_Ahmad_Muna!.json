    "description": "We joined on Sunday, March 9th of 2025 to discuss the recent police raid on the Educational Bookshop with Ahmad Muna. A month before occupation forces had raided the Educational Bookshop in Jerusalem, confiscated and damaged hundreds of books, and arrested booksellers Mahmoud and Ahmad Muna. The police raid followed the large-scale destruction of Palestinian cultural infrastructure in Gaza, the censorship of the Al-Saraya Theater before a screening of the speculative documentary Lyd in Jaffa this October, and the larger history of looting and confiscation of Palestinian books stretching back to the 70,000 seized from homes during the 1948 Nakba and wrongly held under the custody of the National Library of Israel as \"Abandoned Property.\" Ahmad Muna is one of the owners of the Educational Bookshop, which has functioned since 1984 as a cultural, political, and literary center in Jerusalem. The bookshop presents a wide variety of Palestinian scholarly titles and frequently hosts workshops, lectures, and educational events. He spoke with us about the recent raid on the bookshop, his arrest alongside Mahmoud, and the broader context of political repression. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can become a member of the Green Olive Collective at the following link to sustain our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

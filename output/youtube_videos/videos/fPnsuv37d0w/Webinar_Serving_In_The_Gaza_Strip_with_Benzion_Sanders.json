    "topic": "Violence/Confrontation",
    "description": "On Sunday, February 4th of 2024 the Green Olive Collective joined with Benzion Sanders of Extend Programs to discuss how his experience serving in the Israeli military in 2014 in the Gaza Strip motivated him to become an activist against the occupation. Benzion is a veteran of the IDF whose time in the army convinced him that the violence of military rule must end. He spoke about how his experience in Operation Protective Edge helped him realize that Israeli policies of siege, closure, bombardment, and ground invasion do not bring anyone closer to a future of dignity and security. He is the Jerusalem Director of Extend Programs and the former Jewish Diaspora Education Coordinator of Breaking the Silence, an organization of former soldiers who served in the Israeli military since the start of the Second Intifada and take it upon themselves to expose the public to the reality of life under occupation. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can become a member of the Green Olive Collective at the following link to sustain our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

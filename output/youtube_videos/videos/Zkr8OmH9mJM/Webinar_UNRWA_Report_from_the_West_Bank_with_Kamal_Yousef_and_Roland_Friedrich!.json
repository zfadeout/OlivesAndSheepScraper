    "description": "In January 2025 the Israeli military launched Operation Iron Wall, its largest military offensive in the West Bank since the Second Intifada. The Jenin, Tulkarm, Nur Shams, and El Far'a refugee camps were largely depopulated and 40,000 residents were forcibly displaced in the months after. We were honored to join with UNRWA Director of West Bank Affairs Roland Friedrich and resident of Nur Shams Kamal Yousef to hear firsthand about the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe, the lived reality of community residents, the systematic destruction of infrastructure, and the imperative of an immediate political solution. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can become a member of the Green Olive Collective at the following link to sustain our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

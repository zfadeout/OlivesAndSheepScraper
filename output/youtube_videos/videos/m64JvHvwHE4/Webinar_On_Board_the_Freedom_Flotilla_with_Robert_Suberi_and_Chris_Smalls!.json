    "description": "On Sunday, July 20th of 2025 we joined for a live dispatch from the Handala with Robert Suberi and Chris Smalls. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition launched its 37th maritime mission the week before to break the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip and protest ongoing policies of starvation. The vessel was carrying humanitarian aid including food, baby formula, and prosthetic limbs for the children of Gaza. It was named Handala after the famed cartoon of a barefoot Palestinian refugee child by Naji al-Ali and was embarking to Gaza just weeks after the Madleen, another freedom flotilla, was seized by Israeli forces in international waters. We were glad to be joined with crew members Robert Suberi and Chris Smalls live from the Handala to discuss the progress of the solidarity mission, the experience of the crew on board the ship so far, and what motivated them and other crew members to join in tangible solidarity with Palestinians facing starvation, siege, and massacre in the Gaza Strip. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can contribute to the Green Olive Collective at this link to sustain our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://giftjustice.com",

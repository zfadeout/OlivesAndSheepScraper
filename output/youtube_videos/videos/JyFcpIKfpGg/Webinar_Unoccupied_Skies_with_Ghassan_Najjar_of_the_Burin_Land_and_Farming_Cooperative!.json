    "description": "Burin is a community near Nablus that is surrounded on all sides by violent settler outposts. Living in this reality has meant enduring years of settler harassment, military violence, and general disruption of livelihood. The community is coming together to host their annual kite festival on July 11th, and inviting people around the world to fly kites along with them and host solidarity events in our own communities as part of a global call to action. We joined with Ghassan to learn more about the community of Burin and about this powerful initiative. He is the director of the Burin Land and Farming Cooperative and spoke with us about the ways we can act in direct solidarity with community members resisting escalating state violence and settler attacks. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can become a member of the Green Olive Collective at this link to sustain our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

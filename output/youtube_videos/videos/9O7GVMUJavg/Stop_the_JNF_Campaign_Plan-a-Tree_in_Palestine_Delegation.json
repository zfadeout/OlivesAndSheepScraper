    "description": "More info visit: http://www.stopthejnf.org/ Stop the JNF video: The JNF was founded in 1901 for the purpose of acquiring land solely for Jewish people. In the name of environmentalism, the JNF plants trees and builds parks on Palestinian land. In January 2013, a group of international activists form the Stop the JNF Campaign participated in a Plant-a-Tree in Palestine Delegation. The JNF has charitable status is 50 countries and in all 50 U.S. states. The Stop the JNF Campaign is working to revoke this charitable status as part of the ongoing resistance to the environmental destruction, land theft and home and village demolitions carried out by the JNF. The Stop the JNF Campaign is a partnership of the Middle East Children's Alliance (MECA), Stop the Wall - Palestinian Grassroots Anti-Apartheid Wall Campaign, Palestinian Farmers Union and the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network (IJAN).",

    "description": "We joined on Wednesday, November 8th of 2023 for the fifth webinar of Solidarity Speaks, our emergency series giving people around the world a forum to hear directly from Palestinians and Israelis calling for an immediate ceasefire, a release of the hostages, and an end to collective punishment in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Life had become nearly impossible for Palestinian communities in Area C. They were experiencing dramatic escalations of settler violence, severe military lockdowns, and frightening threats to forcibly expel them from their homes. Settlers had taken up arms, given to them by Israeli state officials, and were dressed in army uniforms, making it almost impossible to distinguish between settlers and soldiers. All aspects of life had effectively been shut down for these communities. Under this unlivable reality, many Palestinian families had already been forced to flee. We joined together for an emergency fundraiser to materially support communities facing one of the largest mass expulsions of Palestinians since 1948. We were joined by Ali Awad and Awdah Hathaleen, two long standing advocates against the expropriation of Palestinian land in Masafer Yatta and for the collective rights of their communities in Area C. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can become a member at the following link to sustain the Green Olive Collective and our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

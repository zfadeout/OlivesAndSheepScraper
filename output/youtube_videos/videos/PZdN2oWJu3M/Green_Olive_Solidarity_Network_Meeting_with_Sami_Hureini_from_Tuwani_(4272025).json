    "description": "On Sunday, April 27th of 2025 we joined for our monthly solidarity network meeting with Sami Hureini from Tuwani in Masafer Yatta. Sami is the joint founder of Youth of Sumud, a grassroots collective of young civil resistors in Masafer Yatta that formed in 2017 in response to ongoing settler and military aggression and violence against farmers, families, and school children in the area. They frequently accompany shepherds from nearby villages as they graze flocks, farmers as they harvest their olives, and children walking to school. Sami was unjustly detained at a protest in 2021 against the shooting of his neighbor Harun Abu Haram, and has been in court proceedings since as he defends his right to freedom of speech, assembly, and political expression. Over the months before he also bore witness to some of the most violent settler attacks in recent memory in Jinba, Khalat at-Daba, Susya, and Tuwani. We were honored to join with him to hear more about recent events and the continued steadfastness of the community in the face of military occupation.",

    "description": "On Sunday, March 17th of 2024 we joined with Umar Al-Ghubari of Zochrot for a virtual tour and lecture about the history of Jaffa, the largest and most important city in Palestinian society before 1948. In May 1948 there was heavy bombardment of the city of Jaffa, with many killed and injured. Tens of thousands were deported. Most of the Jaffa refugees who arrived in Gaza eventually settled in a distinct area within the Jabaliya Refugee Camp, established north of the city to house them. It became known as the Jaffa Neighborhood. Everything there is reminiscent of Jaffa. This tour addressed the similarities and dissimilarities between Jaffa and Gaza in different periods and contexts. It started in Jaffa's northernmost neighborhood, al-Manshiyya, and passed through the Hassan Bek Mosque, the Clock Square, the Old City, the Jaffa Port, and the neighborhoods of al-‘Ajami and al-Jabaliyya. Using photos, maps, and documents, the tour painted a picture of the life in the city before and after the expulsion of 1948. This recording of the virtual tour is free and open to the public, but you can become a member of the Green Olive Collective at the following link to sustain our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

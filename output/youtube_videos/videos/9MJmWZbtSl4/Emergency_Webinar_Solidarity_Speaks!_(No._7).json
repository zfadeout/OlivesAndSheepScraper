    "description": "We joined together on Tuesday, November 28th of 2023 for Solidarity Speaks, the seventh session of our emergency webinar series giving people around the world a forum to hear directly from Palestinians and Israelis calling for an immediate ceasefire and an end to collective punishment in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. We were joined by Sapir-Sluzker Amran of Breaking Walls and Naama Cohen of Culture of Solidarity, two long standing community organizers who have worked to develop an intersectional movement for economic and racial justice working with underprivileged communities in Israel including Ethiopian Israelis, Eritrean asylum seekers, Palestinian citizens, unrecognized Bedouin villages, senior citizens, domestic violence survivors, and many others. They spoke with us about the mutual aid, emergency response, and direct solidarity efforts that activists organized in the weeks before with the families of the hostages, with unrecognized Bedouin villages, and with human rights defenders facing legal censure for speaking against the assault in the Gaza Strip. Sapir Sluzker-Amran is the founder of Breaking Walls, a grassroots movement that promotes civic, feminist, and community activism. She is a human rights lawyer and works to archive the unwritten history of social movements. Na'ama Cohen is a community organizer and member of Culture of Solidarity, a community center and gathering space that works to develop justice initiatives, food programs, political education, mutual aid, and relationships across borders. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can become a member of the Green Olive Collective at the following link to sustain our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

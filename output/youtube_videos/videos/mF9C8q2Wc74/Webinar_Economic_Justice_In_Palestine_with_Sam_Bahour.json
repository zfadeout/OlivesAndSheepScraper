    "description": "Since 1948, when Palestinian bank assets were forcibly seized, the state of Israel has consistently worked to develop an apartheid economy. On Sunday, August 6th of 2023 the Green Olive Collective joined with Sam Bahour to discuss the occupation of Palestinian commerce. We explored the failings of the Oslo Accords, the way Israeli policy systematically undercuts the Palestinian economy, and what a future of economic justice and commercial autonomy would mean for the millions of Palestinians currently living under military rule. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can contribute at the link below to sustain the Green Olive Collective and our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://greenolivetours.com/contribut...",

    "description": "From Res Nullius to Terra Nullius: Revisiting Indigenous Histories, Legal Systems and Land Rights in the Naqab 11 October, 2018 Panelists: Bashir Abu Manneh, Nadia Ben Youssef, Debby Farber Moderator: Nadia Abu El-Haj Respondent: Audra Simpson Chair: Brian Boyd The Center for Palestine Studies, in partnership with the NGO Zochrot, and Forensic Architecture, organized a scholarly panel within the framework of the exhibition, Ground Truth: Testimonies of Destruction and Return in Al-Araqib, to expand the discourse on the origins of the dispossession, expulsion, and displacement of the Palestinian Bedouins in the Negev/Al-Naqab, and in particular its historical background and legal aspects. The panelists are scholars and activists involved in historical research, legal geography, and human rights with the aim of situating the case of the Naqab Bedouins within key international debates, such as the territorial dispossession of indigenous peoples, indivisibility, and interrelationship of socioeconomic, cultural, civil, and political rights.

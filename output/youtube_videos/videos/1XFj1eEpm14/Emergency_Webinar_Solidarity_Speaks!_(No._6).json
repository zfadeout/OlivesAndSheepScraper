    "description": "We joined together on Sunday, November 12th of 2023 for Solidarity Speaks, the sixth session of our emergency webinar series giving people around the world a forum to hear directly from Palestinians and Israelis calling for an immediate ceasefire and an end to collective punishment in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. We were joined by Ahmed Muna of the Educational Bookshop and Izzeldin Bukhari of Sacred Cuisine to hear about the ways Palestinian Jerusalemites and cultural workers were being impacted by escalating violence. Ahmad Muna is joint manager of the Educational Bookshop in East Jerusalem. Since 1984 the bookshop has functioned as a cultural, political, and literary center of Palestinian life. The bookshop presents a wide variety of Palestinian scholarly titles and frequently hosts workshops, lectures, and educational events. Izzeldin Bukhari is the founder of Sacred Cuisine. This unique platform is dedicated to the ongoing preservation of Palestinian foodways, cuisine, and heritage. The project highlights the importance of maintaining Palestinian culture through food tours, catering, education, and interactive workshops. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can become a member of the Green Olive Collective at the following link to sustain our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

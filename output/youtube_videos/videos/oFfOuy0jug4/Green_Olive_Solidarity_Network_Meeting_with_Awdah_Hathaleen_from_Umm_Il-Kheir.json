    "description": "On Sunday, July 27th of 2025 we joined for our monthly meeting of the Green Olive Solidarity Network with Awdah Hathaleen from Umm Il-Kheir. We didn't know then that he would be shot the next day while defending his beloved community. Listen here to the last message of solidarity, steadfastness, and coresistance Awdah shared with us on the last day of his life. He ended with the words: \"Thanks so much and inshallah our ways will cross again.\" ________________________________________________________ We stand with the communities of Masafer Yatta defending themselves in the face of escalating state violence, settler attacks, and forced expulsion. Join our global advocacy and mutual aid network to build sustained solidarity and connections with communities in Masafer Yatta and throughout the West Bank living under military rule. *Follow on IG for updates and calls to action: @greenolivetours *Learn more: / dhynddas8j_",

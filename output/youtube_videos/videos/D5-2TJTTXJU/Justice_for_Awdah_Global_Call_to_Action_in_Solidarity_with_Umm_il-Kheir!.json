    "description": "Our beloved friend, colleague, teacher, and civil resister Awdah Hathaleen was shot dead by an Israeli settler last Monday while defending his community. Since then military raids continued almost daily with 18 community residents detained, and the state of Israel refused to return Awdah’s body for burial and imposed conditions for its release, including limiting the funeral to 15 people, and outside the village. Awdah’s wife Hanady and the women of Umm Il-Kheir initiated a collective hunger strike, and the residents of Umm Il-Kheir called for people around the world to host solidarity encampments and mourning tents in their communities as part of an emergency action. We joined for an emergency webinar on Tuesday, August 5th in mourning and solidarity with Umm Il-Kheir as they invited the international community to participate in globally coordinated action in protest of the Israeli authorities and the diplomatic impunity granted by the US, UK, and EU. We talked with civil resister and community advocate Tariq about the ways we could act collectively for justice alongside the residents of Umm Il-Kheir facing state-sanctioned murder, brutal settler attacks, and forced expulsion.",

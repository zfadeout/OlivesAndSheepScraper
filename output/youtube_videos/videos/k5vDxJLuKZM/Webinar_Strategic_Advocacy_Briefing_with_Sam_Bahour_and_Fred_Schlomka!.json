    "description": "On Sunday, November 17th of 2024 we joined with Sam Bahour and Fred Schlomka for a strategic advocacy briefing discussing how to effectively work for social change in Israel/Palestine. In this time of ongoing anguish it is often difficult to know what we can do to express our solidarity and tangibly support Palestinians facing displacement, mass eviction, and unprecedented state violence. Bringing their decades of advocacy and expertise in human rights organizing to bear, Fred and Sam spoke with us about meaningful and urgent ways we can act strategically in support of besieged Palestinian communities in the occupied West Bank. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can become a member of the Green Olive Collective at the following link to sustain our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

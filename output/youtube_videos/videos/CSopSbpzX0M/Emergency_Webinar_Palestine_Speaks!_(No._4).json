    "description": "We joined together on Sunday, November 5th of 2023 for Solidarity Speaks, the fourth session of our emergency webinar series giving people around the world a forum to hear directly from Palestinians and Israelis calling for an immediate ceasefire and an end to collective punishment in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The occupation regime does all it can to fracture Palestinian society and isolate them from each other and the world. We joined with Abed Abu-Shehade to hear about the ways Palestinian citizens of Israel were being impacted by the escalating violence and how the social contract between Jewish and Palestinian communities was being rewritten. Abed is a city council member in the Tel Aviv-Jaffa municipality, and an advocate for Palestinian collective rights and the rectification of historical injustices in Jaffa. This recording of the webinar is free and open to the public, but you can become a member at the following link to sustain the Green Olive Collective and our work to challenge the violence of occupation and advocate for a democratic future: https://members.greenolivecollective....",

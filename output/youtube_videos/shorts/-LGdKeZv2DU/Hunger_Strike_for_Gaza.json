    "description": "Join us in a three-day hunger strike to protest the deliberate starvation policy in Gaza. Tens of thousands are at risk, especially children, as aid remains blocked and limited. This is not a political issue or a security matter - it is a moral disgrace. This initiative, led by Combatants for Peace and the Supreme Coordinating Committee of the 48 Palestinians, is taking place in Beit Jala and Jaffa, with online and remote participation from around the world. Some of our Rabbis will be participating in the hunger strike, standing in solidarity and calling for immediate entry of unrestricted aid to Gaza. We echo the moral cry of our tradition: “Hungry and thirsty, their souls fainted within them” (Psalms 107). Food is a basic right. Preventing hunger is our Jewish and human duty. Join in Beit Jala, in Jaffa, or from wherever you are. Register here: https://forms.gle/C8qPG15S5GytgkQD6",

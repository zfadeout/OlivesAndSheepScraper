    "description": "Listen to landowner Emad Al-Shams as he describes the violent attack on his family’s farmland in Wadi Al-Makhrour, near Battir, on April 23. Settlers destroyed over 200 olive trees, ripped out fencing, and demolished ancient stone terraces. This destruction is part of a broader effort to displace Palestinians for illegal settlement expansion and erase their connection to the land. Rabbis for Human Rights calls on all who support justice to stand with us. We will continue working with Palestinian partners to expose these injustices and resist violence and dispossession. Support this cause, amplify the story, and stand with the people of Wadi Al-Makhrour.",

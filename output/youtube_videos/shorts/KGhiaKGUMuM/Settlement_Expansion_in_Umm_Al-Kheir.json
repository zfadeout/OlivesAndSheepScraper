    "description": "This morning, Eyal Yehuda, a construction company sanctioned by much of the Western world, began preparing land on the outskirts of Umm Al-Kheir for an olive grove. The settlement of Carmel already surrounds the Palestinian village of Umm Al-Kheir on 3 sides. This comes after the installation of a military-controlled gate at the village entrance, used arbitrarily to lock residents in. These actions are part of a broader effort to forcibly remove Palestinian communities and expand Jewish settlement.",

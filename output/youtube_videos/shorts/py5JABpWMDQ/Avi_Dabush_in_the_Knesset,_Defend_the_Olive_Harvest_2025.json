    "description": "For 22 years, we have been accompanying the olive harvest in the West Bank. Every year, Palestinians are restricted from accessing their lands and routinely attacked by settlers. Every year, our activists - sometimes very elderly people - are attacked by Jewish extremists. This is exactly why the organization's CEO said in the Knesset: the army and the police have a duty to protect Palestinian farmers and activists in the field. Watch and share the words of Rabbi Avi Dabush. Donate to the campaign now! bit.ly/defendtheharvest",

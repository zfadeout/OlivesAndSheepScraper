    "description": "This is a snippet from our latest podcast episode. Dr. Dotan Halevi is reading directly from a 1948 Israeli military document, cited by historian Benny Morris. He lists dozens of Palestinian villages depopulated during the Nakba. Many of these names, many now erased or unrecognizable, became the origins of today’s refugee camps in Gaza. This is not just history. It’s the lived memory of displacement still shaping lives today.",

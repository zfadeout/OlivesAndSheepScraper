    "description": "The fourth day of the olive harvest took place in Burin, where dozens of volunteers joined Palestinian farmers in their fields. Together they picked, helped, and stood shoulder to shoulder with them in the face of violence and military restrictions. This is not only the season of harvest — it is a season of choice. A choice to do good, a choice to not stand idly by. A choice to act in the face of occupation. “Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.” (Psalms 34:15) This is our path. 📍 Burin, Fourth Day of the 2025 Olive Harvest 🫒 Vounteer - bit.ly/OliveHarvest25",

    "description": "On Friday, 25.04.2025, twelve activists from Rabbis for Human Rights arrived in Wadi Rahim, South Hebron Hills, to support the Hureini family in harvesting their crops. The land, which is privately owned by the family, has faced repeated incursions by settlers from Mitzpe Yair and Susiya who have been using their sheep to graze on the fields, attempting to destroy the crops and steal the land. Earlier this year, we helped plant olive trees as a symbol of hope and resilience, only to return weeks later and find that settlers had uprooted them. We've also supported the Hureinis during wheat planting season as a protective presence. On Friday, as we worked to move settlers’ sheep off the private land, violence quickly ensued. Settlers arrived with army-like uniforms and attempted to arrest Palestinian minors. One of our activists was choked, thrown to the ground, and had their phone smashed by a settler dressed in an army uniform. Despite the aggression, we stood firm. The army and police eventually arrived, expelled the settlers, and allowed us to continue the harvest.",
